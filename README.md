In this project, I built a GraphQL server from scratch following this tutorial here: https://www.howtographql.com/. The stack I used was based on Node.js, graphql-yoga and Prisma.

graphql-yoga is a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of Express.js. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for GraphQL Playgrounds and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The resolvers of the GraphQL server are implemented using the Prisma client thatâ€™s responsible for database access.
