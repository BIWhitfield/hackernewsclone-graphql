    The path to schema.graphql included in the typeDefs key in the GrpahQlServer at the bottom
    defines the GraphQL Schema.
    Defines a Query type with one field called info
    The Field has the type String and the exclamation mark means it can never be null

    Extending the schema definition:
    1: Extend the GraphQL schema definition with a new root field (and new data types, if needed)
    2: Implement corresponding resolver functions for the added fields
    One convenient thing about the constructor of the GraphQLServer is that typeDefs can be provided either
    directly as a string (as you previously did) or by referencing a file that contains
    your schema definition (this is what youâ€™re doing now).

    The actual implementation of the GraphQL schema
    The structure is exactly the same as the definition inside typeDefs: Query.info

    Notice that a resolver always has to be named after the corresponding field from the schema definition
